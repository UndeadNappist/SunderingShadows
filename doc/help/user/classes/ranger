The ranger is a hunter and woodsman who lives by not only his sword or bow, but also his wits. Rangers, like nature itself, can be of any alignment. Their role and outlook changes depending upon their alignment, but they all have a few things in common. They are more comfortable in the wilderness than the city, and they have a strong affinity for nature that defines them. Their spells are drawn from being one with nature itself, and as such must protect and honor the wilderness. The one view all rangers have in common is that nature itself abhors the creation and existence of undead in any form. Undead are a direct threat to the natural world, and to the essence from which the ranger draws their power, and must be destroyed.

Rangers have the basic combat skills of a warrior, as well as several other abilities to aid their survival. They gain lesser divine spells based on their wisdom score. They %^ORANGE%^<prepare>%^RESET%^ spells from the ranger spell list, which can be viewed with the %^ORANGE%^<spells ranger (by level)>%^RESET%^ command. They %^ORANGE%^<cast>%^RESET%^ the spell by expending a prepared spell from memory. To see which spells you have prepared, use %^ORANGE%^<recall ranger spells>%^RESET%^. To remove a spell from the list, use the %^ORANGE%^<forget>%^RESET%^ command.

During their travels, rangers also connect with an animal companion that travel with them and aid them in combat. The animal companion is gained at level 4 and grows in power with the ranger.

Rangers can cast in any armor they can wear, but not while wielding anything. They will need the perfect caster feat to avoid harming their allies, animal companion and summoned creatures with area-affecting spells.

%^BOLD%^Rangers can begin casting spells at level 6.%^RESET%^
