%^BOLD%^%^BLUE%^Description:
Trolls are a race of giants said to be native to this world. They are stooped, fantastically ugly, and astonishingly strong—combined with their claws, their strength allows them to literally tear apart flesh to feed their voracious appetites. More beast than intelligent beings, they sometimes form clan-like communities, taking shelter either in massive caves, abandoned fortresses, or building wooden forts in lush areas. Some trolls are adept blacksmiths and form clans around their trade. Trolls are violent in nature, but often simple and easily fooled.

There are many breeds of trolls, but it is a troll's appetite and its regenerative powers that make it a fearless combatant, ever prepared to charge headlong at the nearest living creature and attack with all of its fury. Only fire seems to cause a troll to hesitate, but even this mortal threat is not enough to stop a troll's advance. Those who commonly battle with trolls know to locate and burn any pieces after a fight, for even the smallest scrap of flesh can regrow a full-size troll given enough time. Fortunately, only the largest part of a troll usually regrows in this way.

Various types of trolls have different preferences for habitats and hunting practices. For instance, hill and rock trolls may prefer to use a natural camoflage for ambush, while moss trolls prefer to hunt down and torture their prey first. Trolls generally do not pose a threat to the larger settlements, but it is not uncommon for members of others race to avoid known places of troll habitation.

%^RED%^Warning:%^RESET%^ This is an advanced race, known as a PK-race. It imposes disadvantages on your gameplay: You will be banned in most cities and shunned across the realm. You start with your NOPK-flag turned off and other players may attack you because of your race. You may not, however, attack a player of a standard race without additional provocation.
